Hello, I am the sole developer of this fork(along with rrogalski for his help with grabbing the assets) that started development back in late Summer of 2021 and has come a long, long way from what it was over 3 years ago. I have always been with the aether mod since I originally saw paulsoaresjr's let's play of it on youtube back in 2011. I always loved the mod and went on to become a regular member on the official aether server back during the 1.6.4-1.7.10 era and eventually Craftland since that was the only multiplayer port of Aether I at the time. I originally started this fork due to being irritated of the aether mod keeping on being redone every couple major versions (Aether Legacy -> Aether II -> Aether Highlands) instead of expanding upon what was there. This fork aims to expand upon the orginal aether mod with brand new features or features like ones from Aether II, Highlands, or Aether Extended which complement the orginal mod; think of this as Aether 1.5. I will be continuing the mod in the future but for now I will be working on NovaCraft again.

I must give a special thanks to the Delirus for the code they provided me that got the caves generating correctly and help troubleshooting. Also, thanks to the 1.7.10 modding community for feedback on bugs and features. Also MAJOR thanks to rrogalski for his help creating the code to grab the assets, the mod would of never been released otherwise.

For the new amplifier structure there are 2 png files in the jar file that show how to build the structure.

Those who wish to contribute to the mod, here are some things to look at.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major Bugs
-----------
Gloves not displaying in 1st person.
Parachute code needs to be rewritten to not be so buggy.

Other mod integration
----------------------
Having machines such as the enchanter, freezer, and amplifier show recipes in NEI
Baubles support for the aether accessories (Can be turned off if need to, do not want it to be a dependency)
Tinkers support?

Other notes
-----------
If you see anything that is being done twice or legacy classes I forgot to delete, go ahead, and clean it up.
If you have an idea or feature you would like to add go ahead and ask me if I approve of it.
