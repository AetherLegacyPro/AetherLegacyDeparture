Hello, I am the sole developer of this fork(along with rrogalski for his help with grabbing the assets) that started development back in late Summer of 2021 and has come a long, long way from what it was over 3 years ago. I have always been with the aether mod since I originally saw paulsoaresjr's let's play of it on youtube back in 2011. I always loved the mod and went on to become a regular member on the official aether server back during the 1.6.4-1.7.10 era and eventually Craftland since that was the only multiplayer port of Aether I at the time. I originally started this fork due to being irritated of the aether mod keeping on being redone every couple major versions (Aether Legacy -> Aether II -> Aether Highlands) instead of expanding upon what was there. This fork aims to expand upon the orginal aether mod with brand new features or features like ones from Aether II, Highlands, or Aether Extended which complement the orginal mod; think of this as Aether 1.5. I will be continuing the mod in the future but for now I will be working on NovaCraft again.

I must give a special thanks to the Delirus for the code they provided me that got the caves generating correctly and help troubleshooting. Also, thanks to the 1.7.10 modding community for feedback on bugs and features. Also MAJOR thanks to rrogalski for his help creating the code to grab the assets, the mod would of never been released otherwise.

If you see anything that is being done twice or legacy classes I forgot to delete, go ahead, and clean it up.
